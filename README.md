# SortingAlgorithmVisualizer
This visualizer presents the process of three different sorting algorithms
## Version:
Python 3.8.5
## Sorting Agorithms:
### Insert sort:
Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and grows a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort
removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.
### Bubble sort:
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, 
compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 
The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

### Quick sort:
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, 
according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort. The sub-arrays are then 
sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
